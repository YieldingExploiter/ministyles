Mini-Styles for sites to avoid re-writing common styles too often, useful for making simple HTML that doesn't look complete garbage.

## Styles
Below, you can find a semi-complete (excluding ones with >3 stylesheets combined) list of style files available.

To load these, copy the URL & use one of the following in your HEAD tag:

###### Option 1

```html
<style>@import url('PUT THE URL YOU COPIED HERE');</style>
```

###### Option 2
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="PUT THE URL YOU COPIED HERE" />
```

### Uncombined
You can combine any of these' filenames (excluding .css; add .css at the end of the list of styles) with `+` to get a single css file with all of their contents - the contents are in the order you specify them in. You can combine up to **5** styles at once. Any more than that will 404.

You can also import `all.css` to load all stylesheets at tonce
