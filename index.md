# ministyles
Mini-Styles for sites to avoid re-writing common styles too often, useful for making simple HTML that doesn't look complete garbage.

## Styles
Below, you can find a semi-complete (excluding ones with >3 stylesheets combined) list of style files available.

### Uncombined
You can combine any of these' filenames (excluding .css; add .css at the end of the list of styles) with `+` to get a single css file with all of their contents - the contents are in the order you specify them in.
